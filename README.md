# Covid-19-forecasting
We will be able to find the rate of spread of the disease in the upcoming days with the help of regression analysis models and forecast of COVID-19 in India with the next days for better management for doctors and various government organizations.

We used "Rolling Forecast ARIMA" model to do the forecasting.

Following are the steps that we followed to do the forecasting:
1) Collected data, and cleaned it.
2) Tried different model of data analysis and modeling like SIR model, ARIMA model. SIR model didn't work because it only works for a small population. So, finally we incorporated Rolling Forecast Arima model
3) After predicting, we visualized our raw data and the predicted data using different graphs.
